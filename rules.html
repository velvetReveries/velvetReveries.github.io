                        <h3>3.1 Conflict Roleplay</h3>
                        <p>Conflict RP is a popular avenue of RP. Glyph sets precedents to ensure conflicts respect our rules and community intent.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>CONTENT:</b> Heinous or villainous actions may result in content loss (removal from guild, job, magic).</li>
                            <li><b>LOSS OF RP:</b> Villainous behaviors may result in a character being unwelcome in some groups.</li>
                            <li><b>UNPLANNED IMPACT:</b> Consequences may ripple past intended targets.</li>
                            <li><b>MITIGATION SYSTEM:</b> Expect IC actions to have NPC responses.</li>
                            <li>In any conflict, all parties agree to adhere to Glyph rules. A rulebreak does not justify another rulebreak.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>3.2 PvP</h3>
                        <p>Glyph is a roleplay server first. PVP is not a focus, but we set boundaries to minimize griefing.</p>
                        <h4>PvP Rules and Standards</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Combat must be initiated through IC RP with "//PVP INTENT" and an "//PVP ACCEPT" from the other player(s).</li>
                            <li>A player may also "//PVP YIELD" to forfeit, or "//PVP ACCEPT FLEE" to try and escape.</li>
                            <li>If a player crashes/disconnects, disengage. Do not interact with or steal from 'sleeping players'.</li>
                            <li>Logging out or using carriages to avoid conflict is not allowed.</li>
                            <li>Do not kill passive creatures unless they are used to attack.</li>
                            <li>Tools may not be equipped upon creatures that may use them in PvP.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Concluding PVP Encounters</h4>
                        <p>A PVP encounter ends when:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Player/s have been mechanically killed.</li>
                            <li>A player/s surrenders.</li>
                            <li>A player/s have been tranquilized AND handcuffed.</li>
                            <li>10 minutes have passed without engagement.</li>
                            <li>A fleeing player loses line of sight for 1 minute.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Attacking on Sight (AoS)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Random-Death-Matching and Kill-on-Sight (RDM/KOS) is not allowed.</li>
                            <li>AoS is only allowed if agreed to by all players in a ticket with clear terms.</li>
                            <li>Events, Glyph towns, and public transportation are never valid spaces for AoS.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Before committing crimes, you must open a thieving ticket and have a "Calling Card" approved by staff.</li>

                            <li>Do not take more than 3 items and no more than ⅓ of any gold found.</li>
                            <li>After a theft, you cannot return for criminal activities for 72 hours.</li>
                            <li>Do not steal soul-trapped creatures or fertilized eggs.</li>
                            <li>Breaking into a home constitutes a PVP Accept for the thief if the owner catches them.</li>
