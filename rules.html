                <div class="rules-content">
                    <h3>Power-gaming</h3>
                    <p>Power-gaming is strictly forbidden. This refers to playing with the aim of maximizing personal progress at the expense of storytelling, atmosphere, and camaraderie. It's considered unsporting and can undermine the roleplaying experience for others.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Server Etiquette and Immersion</h3>
                    <p>Glyph RP aims to create a unique and immersive fantasy role-play server. Breaking immersion, not respecting the story, or disregarding character freedom and individuality is discouraged. The community values atmosphere and character engagement above all.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Respect for Others</h3>
                    <p>Players are expected to be respectful, sociable, and fun to interact with. Unsociable behavior, argumentativeness, or toxic engagement is not tolerated, and may result in moderation or banning.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Anti-Cheat, Fair Play & No Exploiting</h3>
                    <p>Cheating, exploiting bugs, hacking, or using unauthorized mods is forbidden. Actions that give unfair advantage or disrupt fair play are against server rules.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Roleplay Integrity & Lore</h3>
                    <p>Focused storytelling and character development are encouraged. Players should not metagame or use out-of-character knowledge to influence in-game decisions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Custom Server Features</h3>
                    <p>The server features custom creature spawns, starting questlines, reputation systems, guilds, and magicks. Respect and participate in these systems as intended by the server design.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Server Processes & Technical Rules</h3>
                    <p>Server restarts happen daily at 5:30am and 1:30pm EST. Players must save progress and log out properly during these periods.</p>
